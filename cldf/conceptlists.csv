The ENGLISH column reflects the concept glosses as listed in Appendix 1 of the work, while the SPREADSHEET column reflects the concept glosses as used in an excel spreadsheet containing the raw data which the author was so friendly to provide us. Entries marked with an asterisk in the SPREADSHEET column seem to reflect items which also occur on traditional concept lists; entries ending on the percentage character are those marked as later added by the author in the original source. Why some entries in the SPREADSHEET column are marked with two greater-then characters in the spreadsheet data of the author is not entirely clear to us, but we kept it in order to provide all information that is available.","Satterthwaite-Phillips, Damian",n.d.

In a second run, we tried to map missing nouns that had not been mapped, which appear with an indirect article or in plural or other forms.
